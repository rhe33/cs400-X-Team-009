# X-Team 09 Rules


These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We plan to focus on the most difficult parts of each program as a group.
Also, we will assign a person to work on each method in the program and collaborate when necessary.


## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will use GitHub to automatically update files that were modified.  We also will use Discord to keep track of each team member's edits.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Group meet up / voice call


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We'll communicate with each other and help one another keep up to date to stay on track.  
We'll use text, discord, and GitHub to help stay in frequent communication.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Desribe progress or bugs you have made whenever pushing to the github.
